# BAIS-3300-WebForms
WebForms HW assignment
Created by Bryce Barnett

## Description of Project:

In this project using VisualCode Studio, HTML, CSS, GitHub and Microsoft Azure, I created a static webpage survey. This survey detailed some questions about current Tippie College of Business students and their experiences. 

## Best Pratcices:
In this project, I took a diligient approach to make sure I was conforming with appropriate WCAG and GitHub systems. First and foremost, I started by making sure I was inclusive in all aspects of the form. This was extremely important when asking about the gender of the survey participants. I wanted to exceed the minimum and included up to 9 different gender options for survey-takers. This was key to being inclusive and appropriate when designing a webpage.
The next aspect of this project that was a best practice was ensuring that my webpage met the WCAG standards for accessibility. I did this by ensuring that all my photos had a text option so that they can be hovered and read. I then checked by using a Google Chrome extension to make sure that the text could all be read aloud for those who cannot. Lastly, I checked the contrast ratio with Level AA practices which showed I was at 18.02:1 which was well above the required threshold.
Lastly, I made sure to document all major document changes within my GitHub repository. I wanted to ensure the project management aspect of this project was up to expectations. I did this by making consistent pushes and logs within GitHub Desktop.  Therefore, all data and information was stored in the cloud and well-documented. 
Overall, this  project taught me many valuable lessons about project management, accessibility standards and what it takes to run an approporiate web page.
